# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

## Welcome! üëã

## About the project:
My challenge was to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I could use any tools I like to help to complete this challenge.
